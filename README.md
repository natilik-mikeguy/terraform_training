# Introduction
This repo contains some examples used during HashiCorp Terraform Foundations training. This will be updated with any future useful examples as time allows - it has been pushed up in a rush initially!

Please keep in mind that many examples are written simply for ease of understanding and speed, they are NOT written with best practices and security in mind.
